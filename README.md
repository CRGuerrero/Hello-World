I think that overall the Markdown Syntax will be interesting to learn. I think my strong points will be the more simple things like making words BOLD and adding emojis to my post: :octocat: However, I am very new to the coding language and there is a lot to learn; so I guess my lack of overall knowledge at the moment is my largest weakness. However, I understand that if I study really hard, and put in the effort, I can learn Markdown.

I signed up for "Code it up! With Zach Labar" and "Design with Terry Million"
